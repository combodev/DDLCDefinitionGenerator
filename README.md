# DDLC/Renpy Definition Generator
Generates sprite definitions for new characters, new poses for existing characters, new expressions for existing characters and etc... 

To run this script, you have to install Python 3 on your computer AND make sure it's added to the PATH variables. There should be a setting in the Python setup telling you if you want to add it to the PATH. Say yes. Next up, launch CMD and cd your way to the location of the script! Then, type py definitionsGenerator.py ! There is a launch parameter. If you add -debug after this command, it'll show some debug info for curious minds out there! Oki, that's all! Bye bye~! :3

If you have questions about this script, contact me on Discord -> ComboDev#2071
